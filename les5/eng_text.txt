In the meadow, there a red kalyna, has bent down low ,
For some reason, our glorious Ukraine, has been worried so.
And we'll take that red kalyna and we will raise it up,
And we, our glorious Ukraine, shall, hey - hey, cheer up - and rejoice!
And we'll take that red kalyna and we will raise it up,
And we, our glorious Ukraine, shall, hey - hey, cheer up - and rejoice!
 
Do not bend low, Oh red kalyna, You have a white flower.
Do not worry, glorious Ukraine, You have a free people.
And we'll take that red kalyna and will raise it up,
And we, our glorious Ukraine, shall, hey - hey, cheer up - and rejoice!
And we'll take that red kalyna and will raise it up,
And we, our glorious Ukraine, shall, hey - hey, cheer up - and rejoice!
 
Marching forward, our fellow volunteers, into a bloody fray,
For to free, our brother - Ukrainians, from hostile chains.
And we, our brother - Ukrainians, we will then liberate,
And we, our glorious Ukraine, shall, hey - hey, cheer up - and rejoice!
And we, our brother - Ukrainians, we will then liberate,
And we, our glorious Ukraine, shall, hey - hey, cheer up - and rejoice!
 
Oh in the field, of early spring wheat, there's a golden furrow,
Then began, the Ukrainian riflemen to, engage the enemy,
And we'll take, that precious, early wheat and will gather it,
And we, our glorious Ukraine, shall, hey - hey, cheer up - and rejoice!
And we'll take, that precious, early wheat and will gather it,
And we, our glorious Ukraine, shall, hey - hey, cheer up - and rejoice!
 
When the stormy winds blow forth from the wide steppes,
They will glorify, through out Ukraine, the Sich riflemen.
And we'll take the glory of the riflemen preserving it,
And we, our glorious Ukraine, shall, hey - hey, cheer up - and rejoice!
And we'll take the glory of the riflemen preserving it,
And we, our glorious Ukraine, shall, hey - hey, cheer up - and rejoice!
